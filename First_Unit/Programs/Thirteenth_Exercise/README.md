# Thirteenth Exercise

## Hypothesis of the code
Based on what I can tell from the code, it does pretty much the same as the last one and it's 2 different ways to establish `var` to 0 and the pointer `pvar` to the direction. It also reads if there's any entry data and prints the messages.

## What the code actually does
The code does exactly the same as the **Twelfth Exercise**, it reads a data value, it initializes `var` to 0 and the `pvar` to the direction, the difference is how it changes the value from 0 to 10 in the `var` variable, the way it works on this code specifically is by calling `static void changeVar(uint32_t *pdata)` function; and how it prints, for this print is `static void printVar(uint32_t value)` function, and it's just a normal print function.
