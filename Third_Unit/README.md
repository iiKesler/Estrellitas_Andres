# Sixth Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to create a unity project using what we learned about binary protocols.

First, we get asked what some code fragments are for, the first one is:

```
SerialPort _serialPort =new SerialPort();
_serialPort.PortName = "/dev/ttyUSB0";
_serialPort.BaudRate = 115200;
_serialPort.DtrEnable =true;
_serialPort.Open();
```

the second one:

```
byte[] data = { 0x01, 0x3F, 0x45};
_serialPort.Write(data,0,1);
```

and then the third one:

```
byte[] buffer =new byte[4];
.
.
.

if(_serialPort.BytesToRead >= 4){

    _serialPort.Read(buffer,0,4);
for(int i = 0;i < 4;i++){
        Console.Write(buffer[i].ToString("X2") + " ");
    }
}
```

and this code is used for:

## Initialization
A new SerialPort object is created and configured. The port name is set to "/dev/ttyUSB0", which is a common port name for USB-to-serial converters on Unix-like systems. The baud rate is set to 115200, which is a common speed for serial communication. DtrEnable is set to true, which controls the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal - this can be necessary depending on the wiring of the serial device. Finally, the port is opened with the Open() method.

## Writing to the port 
A byte array data is created with the values { 0x01, 0x3F, 0x45}. This data is then written to the serial port with the Write() method. The parameters to this method specify the buffer to write from, the offset at which to start writing, and the number of bytes to write. In this case, itâ€™s writing the first byte of the data array to the port.

## Reading from the port
A new byte array buffer is created to store incoming data. The code then checks if there are at least 4 bytes to read from the port with the BytesToRead property. If there are, it reads 4 bytes from the port into the buffer array with the Read() method, and then prints each byte to the console in hexadecimal format with ToString("X2").

### In summary
This code is for communicating with a serial device connected to the port "/dev/ttyUSB0", sending it a single byte of data, and then reading and printing incoming data from the device. The specific meaning of the data being sent and received would depend on the protocol used by the serial device.
