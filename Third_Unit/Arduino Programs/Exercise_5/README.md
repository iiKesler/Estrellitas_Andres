# Fifth Exercise
In this exercise, we're sending 2 numbers. Is not really clear for me if it's only in one endian or both, so I did it for both.

### Problems
Some problems with this code is that I have to send the char to print the number a few times before it actuall prints the number, I don't really know why this is but besides that, the program work as intended.
