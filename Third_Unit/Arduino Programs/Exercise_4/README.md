# Fourth Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to understand how to send numbers to the serial. In this case, we have 4 numbers in hexadecimal and using a website, we can convert them to decimal and from there, send them to the serial.

### Sending the same sequence but backwards
The way to send the same sequence of numbers but backwards, we use a for cycle for the arragement but not in the normal ++ way that we usually do, we do -- since we starting at the 3rd position of the array and we start substracting on the positions.
